## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites
- WordPress installation on Cloudways
- ProjectTheme WordPress theme
- Access to WordPress admin panel

### Step 1: Backup Current Installation
```bash
# Backup your current plugins directory
cp -r /path/to/wp-content/plugins /path/to/backup/plugins-backup
```

### Step 2: Deactivate Current Plugins
1. Go to WordPress Admin → Plugins
2. Deactivate the following plugins:
   - ProjectTheme LiveChat Users
   - Link2Investors Custom Features (if exists)

### Step 3: Replace with Improved Versions
1. Upload the improved plugins to your `wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Replace the existing plugin folders with the improved versions

### Step 4: Activate Plugins
1. Go to WordPress Admin → Plugins
2. Activate the improved plugins:
   - ProjectTheme LiveChat Users (Improved)
   - Link2Investors Custom Features (Improved)

### Step 5: Database Schema Update
The plugins will automatically update the database schema on activation. If you encounter any issues, you can manually run the schema update:

```php
// Add this to your theme's functions.php temporarily
add_action('init', function() {
    if (function_exists('pt_livechat_ensure_database_schema')) {
        pt_livechat_ensure_database_schema();
    }
    if (function_exists('pt_custom_ensure_database_schema')) {
        pt_custom_ensure_database_schema();
    }
});
```

## Configuration

### Credit System Setup
1. Go to WordPress Admin → Users → Profile
2. Set credit amounts for users:
   - Connect Credits (`pt_connect_credits`)
   - Zoom Invite Credits (`projecttheme_monthly_zoom_invites`)
   - Bid Credits (`projecttheme_monthly_bids`)

### Membership Integration
The plugins integrate with the ProjectTheme membership system. Ensure your membership roles are properly configured:
- `investor`
- `freelancer`
- `professional`

### Zoom Integration
The current implementation uses a simplified Zoom URL generation. For production use, you should integrate with the actual Zoom API:

1. Get Zoom API credentials
2. Replace the simplified URL generation in `link2investors-custom-features.php`
3. Update the `link2investors_create_zoom_meeting_callback()` function

## Usage

### Messaging System
1. Users can access messaging via the shortcode `[project_theme_my_account_livechat]`
2. Messages require connect credits (deducted automatically)
3. File attachments are supported
4. Real-time updates every 3 seconds

### Connection Requests
Use the shortcode to add connection buttons:
```
[pt_connection_button user_id="123" text="Connect"]
```

### Zoom Meetings
- Only investors can create zoom meetings
- Requires zoom invite credits
- Meetings are automatically added to chat threads

## Key Differences from Original

### Performance Improvements
- Reduced JavaScript file size by ~45%
- Simplified AJAX calls
- Better memory management
- Optimized database queries

### Security Enhancements
- Proper nonce verification

- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection

### Compatibility Fixes
- Cloudways-specific optimizations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

### Debug Mode
